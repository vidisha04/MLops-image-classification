## Project Title
Real-Time Species Detection and Classification System

## Goal
The primary objective of this project is to develop a Real-Time Species Detection and Classification System for use in Scientific Research, with a focus on:
* Automating the classification of thousands of animal and plant images to aid ecological studies.
* Enabling real-time detection and monitoring of species distribution and migration patterns, facilitating data-driven insights into wildlife behavior and conservation efforts.

## Framework
The project will leverage PyTorch, which offers robust tools for building and training deep learning models. This framework will be integrated into the project as follows:

* Preprocessing and Augmentation: Using PyTorch's torchvision library to efficiently handle and preprocess large image datasets.
* Model Training: Building convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures using PyTorch for robust image classification.
* Real-Time Inference: Deploying trained models with PyTorch Mobile or ONNX for low-latency predictions in real-time scenarios.
* Command-Line Interface (CLI): Developing a user-friendly CLI to enable interaction with the application, including uploading images, triggering real-time inference, and receiving classification results. This will make the system accessible to researchers without requiring technical expertise.

## Dataset
The project will initially utilize the dataset described as follows:
* Training Data: 10,000 labeled images, subdivided into 10 folders, each representing a class.
* Classes include Amphibia, Animalia, Arachnida, Aves, Fungi, Insecta, Mammalia, Mollusca, Plantae, and Reptilia.

Test Data: 2,000 unlabeled images requiring classification.

Labels: Mapped as follows:
* Amphibia - 0
* Animalia - 1
* Arachnida - 2
* Aves - 3
* Fungi - 4
* Insecta - 5
* Mammalia - 6
* Mollusca - 7
* Plantae - 8
* Reptilia - 9

The dataset format includes a train folder for supervised learning and a test folder for evaluation and predictions.

## Models
The project anticipates employing the following models:
1. Baseline Model: A simple CNN architecture to establish a baseline for classification accuracy.
2. Advanced Architectures:
* ResNet (Residual Networks): For improved feature extraction and handling complex patterns in the dataset.
* MobileNet: Lightweight architecture optimized for real-time inference.
3. Transfer Learning Models:Pre-trained models such as InceptionV3 or EfficientNet for leveraging existing knowledge and accelerating training.
4. Ensemble Methods: Combining predictions from multiple models to improve overall accuracy.

The selected models will be tuned and evaluated iteratively to achieve optimal performance for scientific research applications.
